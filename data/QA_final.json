Key columns include production metrics, separated into commercial and farm-level outputs, as well as imports, exports, and beginning and ending stocks to track inventory changes. Additionally, it provides data on total disappearance, which reflects overall consumption, and per capita disappearance, presented in various weight formats such as carcass, retail, and boneless retail weight. The data is presented quarterly across multiple years, highlighting trends influenced by seasonal or economic factors. Initial observations reveal fluctuations in production, supply, and trade metrics, with corresponding impacts on disappearance figures and per capita consumption rates.",
